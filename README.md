## Requirements
* Install python3
```bash
sudo apt install python3
```
* Install Pip (Python package manager)
```bash

```

* To run the code, you must install the following Pyton libraries, via pip
```bash
pip3 install Tensorflow testresources Numpy==1.19.3 SciPy==1.4.1 opencv-python Pillow Matplotlib==3.3.2 H5py Keras ImageAI
```
pip3 uninstall matplotlib
pip3 uninstall numpy
pip3 uninstall scipy
