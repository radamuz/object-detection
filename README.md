## Info
* This code was not written by me from scratch, the real author is Moses Olafenwa.  

* The source where I got it is https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/object-detection-with-10-lines-of-code

## Requirements
* Install python3
```bash
sudo apt install python3
```
* Install Pip (Python package manager)
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

* To run the code, you must install the following Pyton libraries, via pip
```bash
pip3 install Tensorflow testresources Numpy==1.19.3 SciPy==1.4.1 opencv-python Pillow Matplotlib==3.3.2 H5py Keras ImageAI

```
